## ALP2023：First Workshop on Ancient Language Processing (Varna, Bulgaria, 7 Sep 2023)

<a href="https://www.ancientnlp.com/alp2023/" target="_blank">Link to workshop website</a>

Co-oragnisers: Adam Anderson (UC Berkeley); Bin Li (Nanjing Normal University); Yudong Liu (Western Washington University); Marco C. Passarotti (Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore)

Co-located with <a href="https://ranlp.org/ranlp2023/" target="_blank">RANLP 2023</a>, the workshop on Ancient Language Processing aims to focus specifically on ancient languages and scripts from the emergence of writing in Mesopotamia and Egypt c. 3000 BCE to the entire world up till 800 AD. We wish to provide a recognized forum to further advance this subfield of NLP, where researchers and practitioners can meet and discuss their latest work, and exchange ideas in addressing shared epigraphical challenges in language processing across various ancient languages, such as non-Latin and non-alphabetic scripts, Right-to-Left, transliteration conventions and fragmentary texts. In addition, we propose shared tasks on Machine Translation for Ancient Chinese and Akkadian, respectively, to provide an opportunity to address the unique challenges faced by ancient language machine translation.

Papers and contributions are encouraged for any work related to Natural Language Processing of Ancient Languages. Deadline for submission is until **July 3, 2023**, for submission guidelines see <a href="https://www.ancientnlp.com/alp2023/call_for_papers/" target="_blank">link</a>.

## ALT2023：Ancient Language Translation Workshop (Macau SAR, China, 4 Sep 2023)

<a href="https://digitalpasts.github.io/EvaCUN/" target="_blank">Link to Cuneiform Machine Translation Task website</a>

Co-oragnisers: Bin Li (Nanjing Normal University)

As a co-located event with <a href="https://mtsummit2023.scimeeting.cn/en/web/index/" target="_blank">MT Summit 2023</a>, this workshop will provide an opportunity to learn about the challenges and latest developments in the field of machine translation for ancient languages. Participants will engage in discussions and hands-on activities to develop a deeper understanding of the field and the techniques used to address the unique challenges posed by translating texts written in ancient languages. The workshop will conclude with a discussion of the results of the hands-on activities and a summary of the key takeaways from the workshop. Participants will leave the workshop with a deeper understanding of the field of ancient language machine translation and the tools and techniques used to address its unique challenges.

In this year’s <a href="https://github.com/GoThereGit/ALT" target="_blank">workshop</a>, we propose shared tasks on Machine Translation for Ancient Chinese and Mesopotamian languages (i.e. Akkadian and Sumerian), respectively, to provide an opportunity to address the unique challenges faced by ancient language machine translation. The technique reports are required to submit after the evaluation. All papers will be reviewed, and will be selected to appear on ACL Anthology.

## Digital Ancient Near Eastern Studies (19-21 Feb 2023)

<a href="https://digitalpasts.github.io/DANES/" target="_blank">Link to the conference website</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7682926" target="_blank"><img src="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.7682926.svg" alt="DOI"></a>

Co-oragnisers: Hubert Mara (eHumanities, MLU Halle-Wittenberg); Gabriel Stanovsky (Computer Science, Hebrew University of Jerusalem)

In recent decades, the rich cultural heritage of the Near East is undergoing a digital revolution. Comprehensive online repositories have made the digital publishing of artefacts in 2D images, interactive 3D models, as well as text editions, a more sustainable common practice. Furthermore, computational analyses of ancient Near Eastern artefacts, texts and art, are starting to become more prevalent, applying quantitative analyses, natural language processing (NLP) or machine learning (ML), to answer questions about these complex ancient civilizations.

The conference, Computational Perspectives on Ancient Near Eastern Literature, Art and Material Culture, established a professional network for Digital Ancient Near Eastern Studies (DANES). The first working groups in the networks will consolidate the successes of recent initiatives led by different research centres, and discuss how best to integrate computational approaches and digital humanities research for ancient Near Eastern texts, art and artefacts.

## Human - Machine Cooperation in Archaeology, Epigraphy and Ancient History (19-20 Feb 2020)

The conference and workshop Human-Machine Cooperation in Archaeology, Epigraphy and Ancient History was devoted to the application of digital tools in projects related to ancient history, material culture, and texts. This approach assumes that the application of digital tools to the study of ancient times shares similar challenges, and the output of such projects may be of interest to all participants in the workshop. We brought together international and Israeli scholars of archaeology, epigraphy, biblical studies, ancient history, computer science, digital humanities, and members of the Israeli high-tech industry in order to investigate the following issues:

*	Presentation of specific projects, their challenges, paths taken to accomplish them, and possible outcomes.
*	The application of newly developed algorithms and technologies.
*	Interaction between teams and technologies – making technology a member of the ancient history and archaeology community.
*	Technology in the service of scholarship – what can technology teach us that we cannot learn without it?
*	The intended users (scholarly community, the general public, others).
*	Databases vs. TEI, and choosing the right conventions.
*	Copyrights vs. opening and sharing our sources.
*	Intensive small learning workshops on the implementation of digital humanities tools.

We would like to thank all participants for their fascinating talks and workshop sessions. A summary of the talks and workshops with abstracts can be viewed in the <a href="/file_links/Abstracts_conference_2020.pdf" target="_blank">following link</a>.
