### Human - Machine Cooperation in Archaeology, Epigraphy and Ancient History (19-20 Feb 2020)

The conference and workshop Human-Machine Cooperation in Archaeology, Epigraphy and Ancient History was devoted to the application of digital tools in projects related to ancient history, material culture, and texts. This approach assumes that the application of digital tools to the study of ancient times shares similar challenges, and the output of such projects may be of interest to all participants in the workshop. We brought together international and Israeli scholars of archaeology, epigraphy, biblical studies, ancient history, computer science, digital humanities, and members of the Israeli high-tech industry in order to investigate the following issues:

*	Presentation of specific projects, their challenges, paths taken to accomplish them, and possible outcomes.
*	The application of newly developed algorithms and technologies.
*	Interaction between teams and technologies – making technology a member of the ancient history and archaeology community.
*	Technology in the service of scholarship – what can technology teach us that we cannot learn without it?
*	The intended users (scholarly community, the general public, others).
*	Databases vs. TEI, and choosing the right conventions.
*	Copyrights vs. opening and sharing our sources.
*	Intensive small learning workshops on the implementation of digital humanities tools.

We would like to thank all participants for their fascinating talks and workshop sessions. A summary of the talks and workshops with abstracts can be viewed in the [following link](/file_links/Abstracts_conference_2020.pdf).
