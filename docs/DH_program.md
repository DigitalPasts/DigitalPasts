title: International Digital Humanities Program at Ariel University
---

The Humanities are the cornerstone of the university as an institution. For centuries, the Humanities have led academia in critical thinking and in-depth research of philosophical, historical, and social issues. The cultural, linguistic and philological ‘toolkit’ which characterizes Humanities’ research is invaluable. However, the Humanities in the last few decades see a diminishing amount of students, and Humanities alumni are left with fewer occupational opportunities. One way to counteract these difficulties is developing and expanding the new field of digital humanities. Digital tools do not only offer another set of skills to give to the students, but also expand the range of possibilities that the traditional ‘toolkit’ can offer. This innovative field combines advanced technological research with the Humanities (such as data-mining, artificial intelligence, big-data, social networks and more). Credit for the program can be received either directly from Ariel university or through Liberty university.

The program is designed to provide both basic and advanced training for students hoping to acquire digital skills and tools. In the first semester, the students will learn an introduction to research methods in digital humanities and their applications, and develop programming skills in the python programming language. The second semester includes advanced classes with practical research questions that can be answered using digital methods, such as data management and analysis for textual, visual, and spatial sources, data visualization, and natural language processing. The program concludes with a summer semester with three workshops for the students to choose from: digital textual analysis workshop (from distant reading to natural language processing), digital editions and epigraphy, and a field workshop in digital archaeology.
