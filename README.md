# About

The Digital Pasts Lab (DigPasts-Lab) is geared towards performing innovative, quality research in digital humanities, with an emphasis on historical research. We aim to create an interdisciplinary workspace among different humanities researchers and between humanities researchers and data scientists, which develops and enriches both worlds.

We can summarize our vision in the following four goals: 

* curation of data in digital methods, be it texts, artifacts, or otherwise.
* using and developing ML models for working with historical sources, particularly cuneiform texts.
* investigating the strengths and weaknesses of new technologies when used for humanities research.
* nourishing interdisciplinary research by using shared digital methodologies, such as linked open data (LOD).

In our repositories you can find information, data and code of our ongoing and past projects.

Scholars, companies, or other parties interested in cooperating with the lab may contact us through the lab email: <digpasts@gmail.com>.
